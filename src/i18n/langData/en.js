      title: 'A world without money',
      time: 'March 25, 2019',
      intro: 'Can you imagine a world without physical money? Currently, the main payment method in the UK are debit cards they are the most frequently used payment method in the UK according to UK Finance, they represent leading finance and banking firms.',
      content: `<div class="avia_textblock  " itemprop="text"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can you imagine a world without physical money? Currently, the main payment method in the UK are debit cards they are the most frequently used payment method in the UK according to UK Finance, they represent leading finance and banking firms.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The volume of cash removed from cash machines (ATMs) is falling fast and people are using cards more frequently for small purchases such as a coffee or a beer.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2006, 62% of all payments in the UK were made using cash; in 2016 the proportion had fallen to 40%. By 2026, it is predicted that cash will be used for just 21%, according to figures from UK Finance.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ATM data show that in 2016, there were 2.7bn withdrawals from the country’s 70,000 cash machines – the lowest number of transactions since 2010. The total amount of money withdrawn at ATMs has fallen steeply in the last few years; in 2016, people withdrew more than £6bn less than they did in 2015.</span></p>
      <p><strong>Cash for criminal activity</strong></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash is the preferred mode of payment for individuals and organisations conducting illicit activities. Peter Sands, Harvard president emeritus and a senior fellow at the university’s Kennedy School of Government, believes that cash provides an untraceable means to facilitate and fuel the criminal economy:</span></p>
      <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No other payment mechanism simultaneously provides anonymity for payor and payee, leaves no trace of transactions, and is so widely accepted.” </span></i></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without physical cash, large-scale criminal activity would be much easier to detect: transactions will have to bypass bank accounts, which are traceable. They may even resort to a more troublesome form of barter trading.</span></p>
      <p><b>Cash for harming the environment</b></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It costs money to manufacture money. The penny, in particular, costs more to make than its actual worth. According to a study done by University of California Davis, it costs the US Mint 1.43 cents to make a penny, even before accounting for the massive environmental impact created by mining, smelting, minting and transportation operations.</span></p>
      <p><b>Cash for enabling tax evasion</b></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash enables the ‘hidden economy’. It’s not hard to see why, as it doesn’t leave a paper trail to be audited or tracked by taxation investigators. For example, when an employer pays a worker in cash under the table, both employer and employee do not pay employment benefits or income tax for the transaction. It isn’t surprising to see why workers in jobs paid primarily in cash — like waiting tables or private tutoring — tend to underreport their income.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Underreporting of income by individuals is the single largest contributor to the tax gap. Tax evasion costs the United States $200 billion every year. </span></p>
      <p><strong>The Solution</strong></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what’s the solution to this cashless world? Well, one option is digital currencies. A number of these currencies are now government backed which means the ease of starting with digitising money is much simpler. </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tech companies that specialise in mobile peer-to-peer payments have helped push the reality of a cashless society to the mainstream. Venmo by PayPal, Alipay by Ant Financial, WeChat Pay by Tencent, and Go-Pay by Go-Jek are some of the services offered by tech giants to enable cashless transactions for billions in three of the four most populous countries across the globe.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde argues: </span></p>
      <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Having central banks issue digital currency can bring about financial inclusivity, better security, and consumer protection, as well as allay privacy concerns.” </span></i></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He goes on to say:</span></p>
      <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The advantage is clear. Your payment would be immediate, safe, cheap, and potentially semi-anonymous. And central banks would retain a sure footing in payments. In addition, they would offer a more level playing field for competition, and a platform for innovation. Meanwhile, your bank or fellow entrepreneurs would have ensured a friendly user experience based on the latest technologies.”</span></i></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Love it or hate it, it is highly likely that government-backed digital currencies will start to emerge in economies as the benefits will prove too enticing for the governments to ignore.</span></p>

      title: 'UK house growth prices hault due to Brexit concerns',
      time: 'March 19, 2019',
      intro: 'The average price of housing has grown by a menial 0.1% this year which is the lowest we have seen since 2013.',
      content: `<div class="avia_textblock  " itemprop="text"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average price of housing has grown by a menial 0.1% this year which is the lowest we have seen since 2013. </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nationwide said the average price of a home rose to £211,966 in January. This was the smallest annual gain since February 2013, when the rate was at 0%.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, Samuel Tombs said it was possible annual prices would go into decline before long.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Increasing numbers of prospective house buyers likely will wait a few months for Brexit uncertainty to fade, forcing sellers to lower asking prices to attract braver buyers in the interim.”</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;“As a result, year-over-year declines in house prices in the near-term should not be ruled out.”</span></i></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September 2018, Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned that leaving the EU without a deal could send house prices tumbling by a third, and in February this year, he added that UK growth would be ‘guaranteed’ to fall in the event of a no-deal Brexit.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way of judging the health of the housing market is to look at transaction volumes, meaning the number of property sales in any given month. A lower number of sales can indicate market uncertainty, which is often triggered by events such as an election or a referendum.</span></p>
      <p>However, with Brexit looming ever closer, house prices suffered a bigger post-summer dip than usual in 2018, dropping from a peak of £232,797 in August to £230,630 in November. The latest ONS House Price Index shows that they crept up slightly in December, meaning that the current average UK house price is £230,776.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kate Faulkner, housing expert and founder of propertychecklists.co.uk, says: </span></p>
      <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘We’ve definitely seen a stagnation in the market over the last year in areas such as London, the South, and East (which had all overheated) and this slowdown has spread to other areas over the last few months. ‘Buyers are holding back in the hope that prices will fall. But it’s not only demand that’s dropping – supply is, too, with many people battening down the hatches until we have a clearer picture of what’s going to happen.</span></i></p>
      <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I don’t think buyers should be put off by fears of a house price crash as long as they mitigate the risks. If you bought a property now, even if it did drop in value in the short term, the market would probably have corrected itself by the time you wanted to move (assuming you stayed there for at least five years).</span></i></p>
      <p>Don’t be alarmed and don’t be put off buying property in the current market, it may be a bad time for selling but lower prices mean a great time for investment and when Brexit is over and done with you will have a safe investment with steady growth.</p>

      intro: 'In January 2019, Patisserie Valerie fell into administration as it failed to grasp onto a financial lifeline from its banks as the company discovered “significant manipulation” of its books.',
      content: `<div class="avia_textblock  " itemprop="text"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January 2019, Patisserie Valerie fell into administration as it failed to grasp onto a financial lifeline from its banks as the company discovered “significant manipulation” of its books. This means there are now upwards of 3,000 jobs at risk and 70% of the (around 200) stores will close immediately putting 900 people out of a job. </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patisserie Holdings, Patisserie Valerie’s parent company who also owns the Druckers Vienna Patisserie, Philpotts, Baker &amp; Spice and Flour Power City has been in a critical situation since October 2018. Its dire financial situation was believed to be ‘potentially fraudulent’ with major accounting irregularities being discovered. </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shareholders were flummoxed as to how a simple cash-based business with less than £10m of debts when it raised £15m from shareholders before Christmas was still struggling to finalise a deal with its banks.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blair Nimmo, joint administrator of KPMG (Auditing company) said: </span></p>
      <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our intention is to continue trading across the profitable stores, as collectively the brands have a strong presence on the high street and have proven very popular with consumers. At the same time, we will be seeking a buyer for the business and are hopeful of a good level of interest.”</span></i></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, the CEO of P.V welcomed Causeway Capital as partners, saying the deal would end a disruptive period of uncertainty for the business:</span></p>
      <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The affection and loyalty for the brand among our customers and employees, and Causeway Capital’s enthusiasm and support for the business, creates for us the foundations for an exciting future for the business,”</span></i></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following this, while there has not been any official announcement, news service Propel Info reported that an internal announcement was sent informing staff that Francis was no longer CEO.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So why are commercial holdings struggling in today’s market? </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 was a difficult year for high street chains, with Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld among the first casualties of 2018.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House of Fraser collapsed into administration in August 2018 and was bought by Ashley for £90m. But its problems are not over: the future of 37 of the 59 stores is still uncertain and Ashley revealed before Christmas of 2018 that the chain had lost £30m in the first three months of his ownership.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The British Retail Consortium has estimated that about 85,000 retail jobs have been lost this year.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the main reasons for failing high street business are online competitors such as Amazon and Asos that sell a wide array of different products, discounted and more often than not with free delivery. </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are rising costs due to the value of the pound now we are exiting the EU and sourcing goods from abroad will become increasingly expensive. The general public are less likely to buy homeware and goods just for the sake of it, we have reached a peak. The majority of young people are now renters, not home buyers so the need for ‘stuff’ has decreased. </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rental prices for shops on the high street are extreme so why would companies stay when their online competitors are thriving with no need for a front facing shop. </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to save these companies, we need to move back into the high street and start buying locally. Where do you shop?</span></p>

      title: 'UK imports after Brexit',
      time: 'March 4, 2019',
      intro: 'The government revealed how it will deal with the rules on imports that will be coming into the UK after Brexit at the end of March.',
      content: `<div class="avia_textblock  " itemprop="text"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The government revealed how it will deal with the rules on imports that will be coming into the UK after Brexit at the end of March. In a striking announcement, it has confirmed that it will still prevent China from “dumping” cheap steel onto the British market.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To deal with alleged trade remedies means that extra tariffs that are put on products being imported into the European Union because of suspicions that they have benefited from unfair support.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long-standing bid by Brussels to raise tariffs is seen as pouring cold water on claims by Ukip’s Nigel Farage that EU membership is a major factor behind the “massacre” of Britain’s steel industry.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will mean existing tariffs being maintained on cheap imports, such as Chinese steel and ceramics, in order to protect British industries from the threat of cut-price competition.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The British government, like the EU, maintains that the Chinese steel industry benefits from unfair state subsidies that allow products to be sold below their actual value.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, Britain will keep 43 of these remedies, with International Trade Secretary Dr. Liam Fox saying the products ranged from “ironing boards to aluminium foil”.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">UK Steel, which represents the steel industry, said it “warmly welcomed” the announcement that anti-dumping tariffs would remain in place “ensuring we do not become the dumping ground of Europe”.&nbsp;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will cut tariffs where we can because tariffs are taxes. It is an act of economic liberation.”</span></i></p>
      <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the organisation’s director, Gareth Stace, added: “this is not to suggest that we believe the UK is adequately prepared to take on full responsibility for trade remedies in a month’s time”.</span></i></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from Chinese steel, the products that will continue to face levies include rainbow trout from Turkey, bioethanol from America and iron products from countries ranging from Ukraine to Iran.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conjunction, the government has said it will opt out of some EU trade remedies, such as lifting a tariff on sweetcorn being imported from Thailand, or solar glass from China. In each case the government has decided that cheap imports don’t affect British businesses significantly but do raise costs for British consumers; those products include sweeteners and Chinese citrus fruit.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the House of Commons, Secretary of State, Dr. Fox said the ability to control tariffs was “one of the real advantages of leaving the European Union”.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laura Cohen, chief executive of the British Ceramic Confederation, said she was still worried that, even if the remedy levies remained, the government would end up cutting tariffs on ceramic products to zero. She stated: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We still do not know what they are going to do with those underlying, most favoured nation tariffs, onto which trade remedies are added.</span></i></p>
      <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If the government drops these to zero in a no-deal Brexit, then ceramic tiles and tableware, and many thousands of other goods manufactured in this country will be in jeopardy because a flood of imports will cause untold damage to our domestic markets.</span></i></p>
      <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are proud British manufacturers and this is a moment for our government to stand up for our manufacturing, rather than give a leg up to foreign businesses.”</span></i></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The government is still setting up a group, called the </span><b>Trade Remedies Authority</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which will carry out reviews into products. </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can we still trade goods with these countries after Brexit safely? If the government monitor transactions carefully enough we should be able to prevent unwanted products entering this country and affecting our industries. </span></p>

      time: 'February 25, 2019',
      intro: 'There are around eight million square metres of available space in town and city centres across the UK due to failing businesses and vacant commercial property.',
      content: `<div class="avia_textblock  " itemprop="text"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are around eight million square metres of available space in town and city centres across the UK due to failing businesses and vacant commercial property. A third of this could be used to pass 45,000 new homes, according to a new report.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report, </span><a href="https://static.turley.co.uk/media/pdf/2019-02/making_sense_of_mixed-use_town_centres_turley.pdf"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making Sense of Mixed Use Town Centres from planning and development consultancy Turley</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says that a proactive mixed-use development strategy could help to address the current housing crisis but at the same time it should not be presumed that High Street retail is completely barren.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The creation of 45,000 new homes is based on the assumption that new residential developments do not exceed the height of existing buildings and the report points out that many more homes could be delivered if taller buildings are considered.</span></p>
      <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Securing the future of our town centres is a critical national issue and one that is rightly getting a lot of attention. These centres are vital to residents, communities and businesses alike and are engines of economic growth. It is vital that these areas are allowed to evolve and that the planning system is match fit to support this,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ said Richard Laming, senior director, head of economics, at Turley.</span></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.turley.co.uk/person/paul-keywood"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul Keywood</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stated that there is a fine balance in terms of planning. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘We believe that for these centres to continue to succeed and serve the needs of their communities they need to embrace a mixed-use future where the balance of uses shifts from what we have traditionally seen,’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">he explained.</span></p>
      <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘A whole place but bespoke approach to each centre, that considers what is needed to make these places attractive and useful for communities and businesses, is essential,’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he added.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Land Agents Aston Mead backed the findings of the report. Charles Hesse, the land and planning director at Aston Mead Estate Agents adds that: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘We should see this is as an opportunity rather than a problem. If we started creating new properties where there are currently vacant buildings, thousands of homes could be built,’</span></i></p>
      <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘We should stop seeing High Streets solely as places to shop, and start to recognise them as potential residential centres as well. There are plenty of people who would love to live right in the heart of the action, and having more people move into our town centres would turn them into more vibrant and dynamic areas,’</span></i></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">By contrast, more people living in the middle of towns would mean that they would continue to be lively even after the shops were closed, helping footfall in local pubs, theatres and restaurants. Having more people around would make them safer, turn them into desirable destinations after dark, and at last breathe life back into our town centres,’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he explained.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report states that: </span></p>
      <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Mixed-use town centres have the potential to generate many benefits for society. Centres can play a valuable role in helping to address the housing crisis through the provision of a range of new homes. They can provide development land in sustainable and accessible locations. They can be multi-generational and healthy places. They can also be a focal point for public and private investment, underpinning flourishing local economies.’</span></i></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trying to bring more business into the town centre so that even when shops are closed the areas are full of people. </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In summary, a lot of investors have avoided town centres for residential housing because of the commercial surroundings and yet these spaces are perfect for the housing that most towns/cities are lacking at the moment. As I have mentioned previously there are multiple options when it comes to property investment it’s not just about the money, it’s about people and their futures. </span></p>

      time: 'January 21, 2019',
      intro: 'Real estate by far is one of the best investments an organisation or individual can make. But, where should you buy in 2019?',
      content: `<div class="avia_textblock  " itemprop="text"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real estate by far is one of the best investments an organisation or individual can make. But, where should you buy in 2019? </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UK is in the midst of a housing crisis and is falling further and further behind each year in terms of delivering the number of homes that our population needs. Combined with the rapid rise in popularity of city centre living, the shortage of housing is creating pockets of extreme demand in some of the UK’s regional metropolises. As such, the HouseToken team with the help of the Surrenden Invest team has done some number crunching (with a little help from data from the Office for National Statistics and Zoopla) to see which hotspots are worth keeping a close eye on over the year ahead.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HouseToken invests in highly desirable commercial property which makes it easy for you to invest in larger property</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the 2019 property investment hotspots:</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Birmingham</span></p>
      <ul>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 population: 1,147,300</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2041 projected population: 1,313,300</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Property price growth over the past five years: 29.46%</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing development to watch: Westminster Works</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a 14.5% population increase on the cards between now and 2041, Birmingham tops the list of 2019 hotspots. The city has a young population compared to the country as a whole, with its five university campuses. Birmingham is the UK’s second city and is establishing itself as one of the most popular locations in Europe to invest in – even more so than London. Thanks to its economic and strategic importance within the UK, Birmingham is attracting billions of pounds worth of investment in citywide retail, commercial and residential space as well as infrastructure projects.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manchester</span></p>
      <ul>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 population: 553,500</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2041 projected population: 631,500</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Property price growth over the past five years: 30.60%</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing development to watch: Ancoats Gardens</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manchester is on track to experience a 14.1% population increase between 2018 and 2041, meaning it will be snapping at Birmingham’s heels in terms of growth. The city has already risen up the ranks in recent years, making it onto IBM’s list of top ten global destinations for foreign direct investment in 2017 (as part of the Manchester-Liverpool metropolitan region).</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manchester benefits from a steady influx of bright, enthusiastic young people. The city is second only to London in terms of its graduate returners (at 58%), as well as its inflow of graduates with no prior connection to the city. Businesses are doing much to harness this talent; Amazon, for example, chose Manchester as the site of its first Amazon Academy, running a series of programmes and events designed to help hundreds of small, local businesses. Future residential developments in the city centre will need to serve these entrepreneurial young professionals.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">London</span></p>
      <ul>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 population: 8,965,600</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2041 projected population: 10,346,000</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Property price growth over the past five years: 32.36%</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing development to watch: Brook House</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">London leads the UK in many respects, as a world-renowned centre for finance, business, education, tourism and more. Over the next 25 years or so, its population is projected to increase by 15.4%, driving demand for housing across the capital. From sleek, centrally located apartments to sprawling houses in the suburbs, London offers every kind of property imaginable, providing homes for workers from across the UK and the globe.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 300 languages are currently spoken in London’s schools, highlighting the diversity of the capital’s future workforce.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liverpool</span></p>
      <ul>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 population: 495,300</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2041 projected population: 554,500</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Property price growth over the past five years: 24.67%</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing development to watch: The Tannery</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liverpool is on track to experience a population increase of 12.0% between now and 2041, as the city continues to attract talented young people as a result of its thriving service sector, healthcare sector and knowledge economy. The city’s extensive cultural offering is also a draw, from its plentiful museums and art galleries to its excellent restaurants and lively music scene.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">42% of Liverpool’s population is below the age of 30, compared with 37% nationally. It is also one of the main forces behind the extensive regeneration that the city is experiencing, while the growing trend for city centre living is creating new hotspots close to key attractions and amenities.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newcastle upon Tyne</span></p>
      <ul>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 population: 297,400</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2041 projected population: 318,100</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Property price growth over the past five years: 23.70%</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing development to watch: Hadrian’s Tower</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newcastle’s city centre population has grown rapidly since the turn of the century. According to the Centre for Cities, Newcastle city centre enjoyed population growth of 112% between 2002 and 2015. The massive jump in demand for city centre living is creating a hotbed of innovation within the housing sector, as developments seek to woo the bright young things who have flocked to the city for work and want prime accommodation in the heart of Newcastle. With a superb social scene and a thriving urban renaissance well underway, Newcastle’s attractions to ambitious young professionals are plenty.</span></p>

      content: `<div class="avia_textblock  " itemprop="text"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investment is a hard concept to grasp for someone who has never taken the plunge. A lot of research, time and money is needed to gain a good and sustainable profit from the money you put in. As intimidating as it seems there are many ways you can invest simply and effectively. &nbsp;</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many ways to invest, one of the top 4 investments of 2019 according to Forbes is real estate, however, this is can be an expensive and timely investment. With many people falling at the first hurdle with not knowing where, when or how to buy property, wouldn’t it be great if someone else could take care of that whilst you reaped the profit? Well with tokenization in REIT’s you can do that.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For every 1GBP you invest in HoT you will receive 1HoT, with this 1 to 1 ratio investment is simple and makes keeping track of your returns that much easier. </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HouseToken invests in highly desirable commercial property, the majority of them located in the elective City of London. As the return is based on rental payments the turnover will be higher and the yield will rarely fluctuate. When purchasing real estate for investment purposes, you need to consider the cost of taxes, utilities, upkeep, and repairs, if you invest in HoT you will not have to deal with any of these other unnecessary worries. The property Portfolio of HouseToken is managed by London &amp; Oxford, a reputable and highly established property management company. </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commercial real estate is the secret to successful investment and has been proven to be the best asset class that will rival central banks’ money printing through stable rental income and capital appreciation. The global commercial real estate market is now over $30 trillion dollars. London still remains as the number one recipient of foreign capital in the world with an IRR close to 10% since 1971.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A big factor in real estate is location and price, the City of London is a financial centre and large companies make their homes here bringing steady investment to the city. &nbsp;The rent-to-price ratio of commercial property in the City of London never dropped below 4%. The percentage rose to 7% during the escalation of GFC in 2008 when such assets were selected by risk aversion funds.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HouseToken’s mission is to Digitalise prime offices in the City of London, which will enable anybody from anywhere to invest in prime office buildings; Easily, Safely and Transparently.</span></p>

      time: 'January 7, 2019',
      intro: 'Real estate brokers are starting to sense the possibilities of cryptocurrency, particularly in the international real estate market.',
      content: `<div class="avia_textblock  " itemprop="text"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real estate brokers are starting to sense the possibilities of cryptocurrency, particularly in the international real estate market. A global real estate marketplace called Propy operates a decentralised registry and creates a space for buyers, sellers and brokers as well as escrow and title agents and notaries to come together to execute transactions using blockchain.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain technology eliminates the need for a trusted (and expensive) party to facilitate digital transactions, allowing those involved in the transaction to use a distributed, peer-to-peer network instead. The implications of blockchain for the real estate industry are vast. Blockchain can make MLS property data more centralised and accessible, title records easier to track and transfer, and it can make transactions more efficient and secure</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Investopedia,</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Previously, transacting high-value assets such as real estate exclusively through digital channels has never been the norm. Real estate transactions are often conducted offline involving face-to-face engagements with various entities. Blockchain, however, opened up ways to change this. The introduction of smart contracts in blockchain platforms now allows assets like real estate to be tokenised and be traded like cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether.”</span></i></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The growing popularity of cryptocurrencies and the use of blockchain in real estate transactions is especially relevant to facilitate international transactions, where monetary controls may be an issue, and where it’s essential to establish digital trust.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real estate listings in markets that are popular with foreign investors, including California and Florida, are increasingly advertising that they accept cryptocurrency. The appearance of these listings is likely driven by two factors: a desire to capture the attention of foreign investors and a desire to attract homegrown enthusiasts who prefer to pay with cryptocurrency. The latter is a growing pool of customers who real estate brokers shouldn’t ignore.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A London Block Exchange study found that millennials are the cryptocurrency fans, with 5% already investing cash in cryptocurrency, 11% “definitely planning” to invest and another 17% “seriously considering” a digital currency investment by the end of this year.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the next five to 10 years, most real estate transactions will be conducted on the blockchain. For tech-forward real estate agents and brokers, it is now time to begin experimenting with cryptocurrency by accepting it as a viable alternative to cash financing. Real estate brokers who want to attract this customer can advertise a willingness to conduct transactions with cryptocurrency to stand out in a crowded space and cultivate a tech-savvy brand. The volatility in the cryptocurrency market demands caution, but cryptocurrencies are poised to disrupt the real estate industry. Real estate brokers who want to stay ahead of the curve should embrace cryptocurrency – the future of real estate. </span></p>

      content: `<div class="avia_textblock  " itemprop="text"><p>The total returns of the FTSE (financial times stock exchange) and NAREIT (National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts) stated that the REITs Index rose 4.5% &nbsp;in November, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 2.0%.</p>

      <p>On the demand side, Wimmer noted that home prices have spiked relative to rents. <em>“These are levels that we haven’t really seen since before the recession, so it just means that it’s even more expensive to purchase a home relative to what it is to rent an apartment.”</em></p>
      <p>Bellisario noted that<em> “it’s gotten harder to buy a home because less is for sale because people don’t want to move, interest rates are moving higher, [and] it’s harder to build a home because costs are going up.”</em></p>
      <p>In other sectors, returns for health care REITs gained 8.3% in November, while data centre REITs returns added 5.9%. Industrial REITs returns added 4.6% last month.</p>
      <p>REITs is steadily rising, as investment in rent is seeing more demand in the next couple of years. Great news for REITs investors.</p>

      time: 'December 11, 2018',
      intro: 'Are stable coins the future of cryptocurrency? Do we need a stable asset in order to support digital currencies so we can avoid volatility in investment',
      content: `<div class="avia_textblock  " itemprop="text"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the creation of Bitcoin in 2009, Cryptocurrencies popularity has dramatically increased giving way to a new age of investment. Some of the more well-known digital currencies such as Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum and Litecoin have been associated with a risky, unstable investment. On any given day, it is common to see an increase or decrease of up to 10-20%. When you invest in a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin it comes with a risk associated with the current digital currency market position. Just like stocks, the fluctuation of the price of one coin varies fairly drastically from day to day and unfortunately,&nbsp;this increases the volatility. However, blockchain technology has enabled the security and verification of cryptocurrency to be a highly desirable trait amongst investors.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So you have volatility and risk of cryptocurrency, but we have also the security of Blockchain technology, how can we turn this into a stable solution whilst still using blockchain technology for verification?</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introducing, stable coins. Stable coins are digital assets linked to a ‘stable’ goods such as gold, or in House Token’s case – commercial property. This gives the currency a reliable backing which provides a steady dividend’s yield over the duration of the investment. &nbsp;According to Forbes, an optimal cryptocurrency should have the following four traits: “price stability, scalability, privacy, and decentralization”. Stable coins provide all of these desirable attributes and enable your investment to steadily increase whilst protecting the annual returns which in House Token’s case is 100%. A stable coin will also expedite the process of blockchain adoption since it allows traders, merchants and consumers to complete transactions using a currency that is strong, steady and familiar.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A state-issued stable coin is an encrypted digital asset whose value equates to a 1:1 value of a country’s fiat currency (for example 1 HoT = 1 GBP). This stabilises investment and increases market confidence a reputation which other digital currencies have tarnished. </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State efforts to issue digital dollars are already underway: Russia is hoping to launch its very own CryptoRuble; Kyrgyzstan plans to create its own cryptocurrency backed with gold; the Swedish central bank has proposed an e-Krona, and China is arguably ahead of the pack with its tests to build a domestic cryptocurrency that will exist alongside the yuan. Tether is currently the most well-known stable coin on the market, backed by the US dollar, there are some doubts surrounding this if these assets are real</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are stable coins the future of Cryptocurrency? And will they provide a new form of trust and stability to the world of cryptocurrency? If anything, it is a great start in encouraging people to get involved with this new age of digital currency and a sure way to see a steady, stable investment in years to come.</span></p>

      title: 'What is Cryptocurrency and where did it start?',
      time: 'December 10, 2018',
      intro: 'In 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin the first realised form of Cryptocurrency. Initially, Bitcoin caused a stir with its revolutionary approach to virtual transactions.',
      content: `<div class="avia_textblock  " itemprop="text"><div class="col-lg-8 col-md-9 col-sm-10 col-10 mx-auto col-xl-7">
      <div class="lead">
      <p dir="ltr">In 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin the first realised form of Cryptocurrency. Initially, Bitcoin caused a stir with its revolutionary approach to virtual transactions. If you have been newly introduced to this currency, you may not be aware of the fact that Satoshi Nakamoto is actually a pseudonym and the identity of the creator is unknown, although many theories have circulated, none have been confirmed.</p>
      <p>Previously, other developers had created proposals for their version of Cryptocurrency, including Wei Dai who proposed ‘b-money’ and Nick Szabo whos suggestion was ‘bitgold’.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin is a type of digital asset and works as a medium of exchange, in other words, you can transfer and sell your virtual coins. Cryptocurrency is decentralised which means that unlike a bank, there is no one person or company that protects your assets. The protection comes from the series of miners that are all connected to the blockchain system.</p>
      <p>The premise behind Cryptocurrency is a little complex, especially for those who are not familiar with the technology, so let’s take it back to basics. Bitcoins are virtual coins, these virtual coins use cryptography to secure the transactions. What this means is that in order to obtain Bitcoins or any type of Cryptocurrency you have to make a ‘miner’ that will try and solve the complex algorithm that protects the coins. A miner is a computer or a machine that connects to the blockchain and then starts to mine coins.</p>
      <p>But will they ever run out of coins? The short answer is yes, there are set number of coins at the beginning of the Cryptocurrencies life, for example, bitcoin created 21 million coins and 80% of those coins have already been mined. However, this doesn’t mean that you can’t still earn coins, you see, when a transaction happens, miners who are all part of the blockchain earn a set amount of coins for verifying the fact that the owner of those coins has enough to complete the exchange. In turn, this means that you can earn a set amount of coins for every time you verify, even if you are no longer able to ‘mine’ the coins.</p>
      <p>So how do you actually get coins? well, when you mine ‘blocks’ which are part of the ‘blockchain’ each individual block holds a certain algorithm that needs to be solved in order to obtain the coins, to get the coins you have to ‘crack the code’. The blockchain is essentially a long chain of ‘blocks’ and the previous block will communicate with the next one to form the next problem that needs to be&nbsp;solved. The whole system is open source to achieve full disclosure.</p>
      <p>The first ever crypto transaction was the infamous 10,000 bitcoin pizza purchase, which is now worth around 20 million USD eight years later, that’s one expensive pizza…</p>
      <p>A number of people find the concept of cryptocurrency daunting and also quite deceptive. Investing in cryptocurrency is a risk and the investment itself is a volatile process. There is also a risk that the company who has created the currency could lose its funding and not raise enough during their ICO (Initial Coin Offering), this would cause a loss in the investors they have already put money into the venture. Along with this there is a risk of mismanagement when it comes to the start-up team, be sure to look at the background of the people in these companies to understand if they are capable of handling the ICO and the coins, previous experience in funding these types of ventures would be a good trait to look for.</p>
      <p>Cryptocurrency is a difficult concept to grasp but the best way to learn more is to read more articles, ask others and try mining/investing for yourself. This revolution is not going anywhere fast and if staying up to date with the latest trends is important to you, this is certainly something you need to look into. It could turn into a prominent payment method for the future, in fact, some companies already accept bitcoin and others will follow.</p>
      <p>We hope this article helped explain the basics of bitcoin and cryptocurrency, as you can see there is a lot to learn and a whole array of resources out there for you to explore!</p>

      content: `<div class="avia_textblock  " itemprop="text"><p><strong>LONDON, 21 November 2018 </strong></p>
      <p>Potential crypto-asset investors favour established jurisdictions such as Switzerland, the UK and US as the best regulatory environment for trading and investment operations in this new asset class, according to a survey by investment firm London &amp; Oxford and OMFIF.</p>
      <p>The survey published today in the&nbsp;‘Global crypto-asset regulatory landscape’ report, shows that more than 40% of investors favoured these three locations.</p>
      <p>The report provids insights into prospects for institutional investment in crypto-assets, highlighting which jurisdictions are most favourable or restrictive.&nbsp;Other respondents believe&nbsp;Australia, Bermuda, Hong Kong and Malta&nbsp;are the most attractive&nbsp;jurisdictions.</p>
      <p>Investors suggested that tokenisation of larger, more illiquid assets such as real estate, and the creation of products such as bitcoin exchange traded funds, make the crypto-asset market more attractive.</p>
      <p>‘London &amp; Oxford is proud to team up with OMFIF in producing the first in what we aim to become a series of reports on new investment categories,’ said Paul Newton, founder and chairman of London &amp; Oxford. ‘We place emphasis on looking at best practice in regulation.’</p>
      <p>OMFIF is adopting a threefold strategy to follow up the report’s findings.&nbsp; This involves convening round tables and carrying out research with industry experts to examine future growth areas and increase incentivisation for more investment involvement. OMFIF will seek to work with the Financial Stability Board, the International Organisation of Securities Commissions, the Basel committees and other regulators to elucidate how risks can be mitigated.</p>
      <p>The survey&nbsp;underlines investors caution on crypto-assets. Only 38% of respondents have invested in it this asset class, while 15% have invested in initial coin offerings.</p>
      <p>Respondents included asset managers, family offices, blockchain hedge funds, crypto-platforms and sovereign funds.</p>

      content: `<div class="avia_textblock  " itemprop="text"><p>Crypto-assets and how they should be regulated are of growing importance for financial markets and investors. Central banks and regulators are making intense efforts to understand the opportunities, limitations and threats. The blockchain technology behind well-known crypto-assets contains enormous potential for efficiency-enhancing and costsaving applications for digitally recording subscriptions, safe custody and trading activities. Less benignly, there are widespread fears that an untrammelled move into an uncharted investment territory could, in the event of malfeasance or malfunction, critically undermine confidence and restrict future innovation. A brave new world beckons; but we must all work together to make this new feature of the investment landscape more appealing and less risk-laden.</p>
      <p>London &amp; Oxford is proud to team up with OMFIF in producing the first in what we aim to become a series of reports on new investment categories reflecting technological advances across financial markets. We place emphasis on looking at best practice in regulation, an issue of paramount importance for many investors. Weighing up the different taxonomies for classifying crypto-assets and ICOs is a vital condition for solidifying this asset class within a secure regulatory framework. We are investigating attentively ways of reducing the hurdles to entering the market. This includes tokenising larger, more illiquid assets or creating products such as exchange-traded funds that can be digitally recorded employing blockchain technology. We hope this report will spur conversations with issuers and investors, as well as relevant regulators and other authorities, who will be helpful in guiding the way to beneficial transactions. As such, I commend this report to a wide readership.</p>
